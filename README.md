# Project Description
Is there a relationship between the weather and restaurant industry value? The team will utilize machine learning techniques to identify relationships between historical weather patterns by zip codes and the stock price of Bloomin’ Brands, Inc (BLMN). If such relationships exist, what particular weather features are the biggest drivers? Which states, if any, have a higher correlation to stock price based on  weather events? Can we make short-term predictions on BLMN (or other public food service companies) stock price based on a weekly weather forecast?
